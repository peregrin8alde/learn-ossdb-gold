Composite aggregation is a strong form of aggregation that requires a part object be included in at most one composite 
object at a time. If a composite object is deleted, all of its part instances that are objects are deleted with it.

A part object may (where otherwise allowed) be removed from a composite object 
before the composite object is deleted, and thus not be deleted as part of the composite object.

Composite aggregation
部分側は他と共有不可
部分側は全体と同じ寿命なのが普通
全体の削除前に部分側を分離して他に移管すれば寿命を別にすることも可能
古い UML では寿命が必ず一致で全体側の多重度が 1 固定？
